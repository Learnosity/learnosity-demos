# Learnosity API Demos

Jumpstart your integration of the Learnosity API's into your learning platform.

## Overview

This repository has been designed to allow users to quickly view and interact with some of the core
Learnosity APIs.

Each page shows a basic integration to a specific Learnosity API which you can utilise and learn from.

There is also a SignatureUtils class which simplifies the generation of the security signatures for each of the types.

## Getting Started

* [Download the package](https://github.com/Learnosity/learnosity-php-examples/archive/master.zip)
* Put in a web accessible directory with PHP
* Replace the consumer_key, consumer_secret and name fields in the config.php file.
* Test it out by browsing to index.php

If you have PHP 5.4 you can use the local server to quickly get up and running, no Apache/IIS is required.

php -S localhost:5000
```

Visit [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) in a browser.
