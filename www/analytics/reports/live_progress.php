/*
 * Hey there, demos visitor!
 *
 * You might have reached this page via the View source link on the demos site, an are know a bit bemused as this was
 * not the code you were looking for.
 *
 * For ease of demonstration, the root of the live progress demos (this file) only shows 4 iframes containing the
 * report, and 3 assessements. The source for the iframes is whas you are looking for.
 *
 * Fear not, you can easily reach them. As you can see below, they are in the `liveprogress` subdirectory, and are named
 * `report.php`, and `assessment_n.php`, respectively. All assessments pages look the same, and actually include a
 * common file, `assessment.inc.php`, which is probably what you'd be most inretested in.
 *
 * Assuming you are viewing this file in Github, you can easily access those files by hitting the `t` key now, which
 * will bring up a file-search form. You can then just start typing the name of the file you're after, and hit `Enter`
 * when it is shown. As mentioned before, the most interesting files are
 * - www/analytics/reports/liveprogress/report.php (e.g., type `livproreport` in the search form),
 * - www/analytics/reports/liveprogress/assessment.inc.php (e.g., type `liveproassessinc` in the search form).
